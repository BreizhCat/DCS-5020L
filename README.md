# DCS-5020L
Monitor my camera

Just my own adaptation from project [DLink-Ptz-Tool of TrafeX] and (https://github.com/TrafeX/DLink-Ptz-Tool) [His website].(https://www.trafex.nl).
I have remove some feature in Ptz.php because my camera doesn't have them. 
Also, I wasn't able to display the steam of my camera as it is done in the _main_ project. I have used a fixed image with a timer to refresh. 

# Use

Update the config file with your own configuration and rename it just *config.php*
